# testrun_app

Andrew VanDerKolk's new Flutter project.

## End Goal

A responsive app with navigation, user accounts and logins, a tool to upload a pdf (of a transcript) and transform the transcript into an array, and a tool that uses the array to infer about degree progress and suggest courses to register for. Like a digital Academic Advisor.

### Description

This project is a my starting point for learning flutter and REST Api.

Resources I have used

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)

For more information about Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
